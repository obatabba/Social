# Social Platform (my twitter)

> This is a project that I've created while I was practicing django and learning about dynamic web pages and utilizing basic AJAX calls and HTMX.

It is a basic social media platform, which allows users to:
- Create accounts and enter personal information.
- Log in and out with username and password, with elegant forms and clear error messages.
- Create posts, and attach images.
- Edit or delete posts and dynamically update parts of the page to reflect the changes without a full page reload.
- Like/unlike posts.
- Edit profile details and upload profile images.
- Browse users profiles, view their posts and follow/unfollow them.
- Modern styles with bootstrap.
